**features:** real-time gotham city map tracking, simulated batmobile controls including steering, gear shifts, throttle/braking mechanics, and themed dashboard interface courtesy of wayne enterprises.  

# custom features: crime escalation system

batman doesn't respond to petty crime around the city. commissioner gordon knows the bat-signal should be reserved for emergent situations that go beyond the gotham police department's capabilities. batman's batmobile is fitted with a unique crime severity system that will immediately flag his attention when dangerous, high-level crime is being committed around the city.

**core functionality:** expansion of pre-existing traffic alert structure. tracks high-level/critical crime events across the city that requires intervention from batman. these crimes include: organized crime, terror threats, armed activity, infrastructure/cyber attacks, and arkham-related occurrences like riots and prisoner escapes. 

# custom features: bat-signal

no batmobile would be complete without an intricate alert system to tell batman when and where he's needed across gotham city.

**core functionality:** built from the pre-existing traffic alert structure, the bat-signal works off of alert severity. when severity hits critical levels, the bat-signal alert fires across the dashboard.

# changelog

this file will contain relevant notes, pre and post development reflections, as well as detailed descriptions of daily work to supplement issues filed with github.

## pre-development reflection:

<blockquote>i know that this isn't a mandatory component of this project, but keeping a log and detailed account of my process is helpful to me and keeps me accountable along the way!</blockquote>
<br>

instead of copying and pasting everything, i am choosing to type out each provided code block myself to help establish mind + memory connection and make the coding process feel more personal. i found this helps keeps me engaged, and writing out notes throughout my files work as a guide for me to look back to later.

trying to focus so much on ensuring my coding style was identical to what was pre-written for us was increasing my sense of burnout and stress. after the brief break between the end of module 2 and the beginning of modules 3 + 4, i decided to go back to my roots for this last project and involve myself as much as possible. as a coder who has adhd, finding these little "tricks" that help me feel more confident and excited about developing is crucial and a process that i believe will continuously evolve as my skills and stylistic choices progress over time.

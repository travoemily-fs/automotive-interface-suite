## pre-development reflection

> i know that this isn't a mandatory component of this project, but keeping a log and detailed account of my process is helpful to me and keeps me accountable along the way!

instead of copying and pasting everything, i am choosing to type out each provided code block myself to help establish mind + memory connection and make the coding process feel more personal. i found this helps keeps me engaged, and writing out notes throughout my files work as a guide for me to look back to later.

trying to focus so much on ensuring my coding style was identical to what was pre-written for us was increasing my sense of burnout and stress. after the brief break between the end of module 2 and the beginning of modules 3 + 4, i decided to go back to my roots for this last project and involve myself as much as possible. as a coder who has adhd, finding these little "tricks" that help me feel more confident and excited about developing is crucial and a process that i believe will continuously evolve as my skills and stylistic choices progress over time.

## daily work log

`thursday, december 11th:` began development process by creating project folder. completed steps 1-7 inside p.1 foundational architecture lesson

`friday, december 12th:` committed project to git after ensuring mobile-controls and tablet-cluster weren't being viewed as individual repositories. completed the entirety of p.1 foundational architecture with successful server connection and html test-client output.

`saturday, december 13th:` completed the entirety of p.2 phone interface with successful server and client side connections.

`sunday, december 14th:` completed lesson 3, tablet interface with successful server and client side connections on tablet and mobile interfaces. added throttling optimization to the useVehicleConnection hook inside mobile-controls and animation cleanup inside tablet-cluster for svg-heavy components speedometer, rpmgauge, and statusindicator files.

`tuesday, december 16th:` completed all of lesson 4, web interface along with video demonstrating successful mobile, web, tablet & server side functionality. have established what final project will be, requiring little change to current file structure to begin implementing new features. also fixed the rest of the issues present in the debugging assignment; will add my annotations to my chosen error for filming later today. desktop interface issue is now fixed and shows all active device connections on dashboard page.
